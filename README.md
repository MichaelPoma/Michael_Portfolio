# Data Science Portfolio

## [Project 1: University Grant Predictions Interpretability Tool: Project Overview](https://github.com/MichaelPoma/ds_melbourne_grant_predictions_proj)
- Built a visual interpretability tool for a university grant prediction model developed in a Kaggle competition **(Nutritional Label)**
- Engineered missing data and one-hot encoded categorial values
- Investigated attribute weights and disparities within Birth Country and Home Language features (Recipe & Diversity)
- Generated a statistical description across 12 different subpopulations (Ingredients)
- Determined the robustness of the prediction methodology on data (Stability)
- Measured the group fairness through disparate impact and statistical parity (Fairness)

## [Project 2: Data Science Air Pollution Predictions: Project Overview](https://github.com/MichaelPoma/ds_air_pollution_predictions_proj)
- Created models to help meteorologists estimate air pollution measurements (RMSLE ~ 0.233)
- Trained over 7000 entries of weather information and sensor data measurements
- Performed time series decomposition to visualize seasonality, trend, and residual patterns in data
- Engineered lag features based on autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation patterns
- Optimized CatBoostRegressors to reach the best hyperparameter tuned models
- Placed in top 27% of *Kaggle Tabular Playground Series - Jul 2021* competition

## [Project 3: Data Science SHAP Explanations: Project Overview](https://github.com/MichaelPoma/ds_20newsgroups_shap_explanations_proj)
- Created a classifier to classify documents based on religious sentiment (accuracy ~ 91%)
- Preprocessed data using a TfidfVectorizer to transform text to feature vectors and filter out uncommon words
- Identified words that contributed to misclassification of documents and in which documents
- Generated visual explanations of feature values using SHAP
- Optimized SGDClassifier using chi-square filter feature selection to improve accuracy
